                    <h2>For the very new Ones</h2>
                    <h4>Welcome to The ETH Guide! Are you new to ETH? Then you are at the right place! Not only made for newbies,
                        this website should be a helping hand from students to students, because let's be honest, every one
                        of us gets confused once in a while at ETH, am I right?


                        First, you might want to find out to what Study Association you belong to. For this, search for your course 
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://vseth.ethz.ch/language/en/organisations/#study-associations"> here.</a>
                        To find the website of your student association, <a href="https://vseth.ethz.ch/language/en/study-associations/"> click here</a>.
                        
                    </h4>

                     

                    <h2>How to start</h2>
                    <h4> The first thing you might want to do is to login to
                        <a target="_blank" href="http://mystudies.ethz.ch">MyStudies</a> and get your timetable. You should by now have set a new password or at least know
                        the one given to you by ETH. Once you're logged in, you will have to press the button saying "Functions".
                        <br>
                        <img src="functions.png">
                        <br>Next, you will be clicking on "Course registration".
                        <br>
                        <img src="reg.png">.
                        <br>The next step will be individual for each one of you. You'll have to choose your programme. As an
                        example I've chosen to show "Computer Science Bachelor's Degree Programme".
                        <br>
                        <img src="courses.png">
                        <br> There's no need to fill out more then this, just hit the "Search" button and you'll get a list of
                        the courses you will be taking. Save your progress and you're ready to see your "Course Schedule".
                        You should have the option to click on it at the top of the page.
                        <br>
                        <img src="schedule.png">
                        <br> At first, it will all seem quite chaotic. Don't worry. At the top of the table click on "Timetable".
                        This should look more familiar ;).
                        <br>
                        <img src="list.png">
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <img src="ttable.png">
                        <br> In the list, you'll only have to tick some of the courses, but this is not quite important yet...
                        On the timetable, there's a number on top of every course followed by one letter:
                        <strong>"V"</strong> which comes from "Vorlesung", german for Lecture. Those normally take place in relatively
                        large lecture rooms. Or
                        <strong>"U"</strong> for "Ãœbung", the german word for exercise. Those classes will be held in classrooms
                        like the ones you probably know from Gymi, and they will be held by teaching assistents, which normally
                        are students from a higher semester. You should treat them like people your age, and not like a teacher,
                        trust me.
